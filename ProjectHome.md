A work in progress window manager written in pure python.

Current Features:
  * virtual desktops
  * focus stack
  * window maximisation/moving/resizing
  * cairo drawn widgets/window decorations
  * user configuration
  * probably more... you'll have to check it out!

**Work on the current version has been halted.** We are now ~~~looking to write~~~ writing an xcb based window manager.

samurai-x is written entirely in python using ctypes. The xlib module is from http://pyglet.org and the cairo module is generated by pyglet tools - so big respect to pyglet!

samurai-x is very easy to extend and customise so its suitable for prototyping, using as a real window manager or just to learn about xlib programming.

samurai-x was originally based on code from http://awesome.naquadah.org/ ( although there is little resemblance now ). Also viewing the code from http://fluxbox.org has been an essential resource.
